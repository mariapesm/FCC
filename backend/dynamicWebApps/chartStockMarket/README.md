Chart the Stock Market
==========================

## Objective

Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: http://watchstocks.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to ~Heroku~ wherever.

It should be live at [https://vesper-fcc-stockmarket.glitch.me/](https://vesper-fcc-stockmarket.glitch.me/).

## User Stories

- I can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock.
- I can add new stocks by their symbol name.
- I can remove stocks.
- I can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock. For this you will need to use Web Sockets.

## Goals

- [X] This project needs to be responsive and mobile friendly

## Notable Technologies

WebSockets, [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/), and Yahoo Finance.
