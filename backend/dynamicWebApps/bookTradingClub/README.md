Manage a Book Trading Club
==========================

## Objective

Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: http://bookjump.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to ~Heroku~ wherever.

It should be live at https://bookshare.glitch.me/.

## User Stories

- I can view all books posted by every user.
- I can add a new book.
- I can update my settings to store my full name, city, and state.
- I can propose a trade and wait for the other user to accept the trade.

## Goals

- Continue with similar stack and tooling as before (MERN, auth, unit tests, lint, webpack)
- Keep it mobile friendly
- TDD as much as possible
- exercise a bit more creativity on functionality

## Notable Technologies

- Google Books API for searching, title, authors, cover, etc
- http://www.zippopotam.us/ for pairing zipcodes to locations
