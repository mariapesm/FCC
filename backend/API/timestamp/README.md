Timestamp Microservice
======================

created for the freeCodeCamp backend certification

## User Stories

- I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016)
- If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
- If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.

It should be live at [https://vesper-fcc-api.glitch.me/timestamp/](https://vesper-fcc-api.glitch.me/timestamp/)
